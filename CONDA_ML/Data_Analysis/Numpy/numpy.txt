1. Numpy : conda install numpy / pip install numpy
    
       - Linear algebra lib for python
       - Binding to c libraries
       - Numpy Arrays 
             . vectors (1-d arrays)
             . Matrices (2-d arrays)
                * Matrix can still have only one row or one column
                
           > We can cast list into Array (1-d)
           > We can cast list of list (2-d / matrix)
