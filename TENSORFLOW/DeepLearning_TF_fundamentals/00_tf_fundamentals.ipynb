        "\n",
        "Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely we'll use a library such as TensorFlow. This is because it contains many of the most common machine learning functions we'll want to use.\n",

        "## What we're going to cover\n",
        "\n",

This is because TensorFlow has modules built-in (such as [`tf.io`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/io) and [`tf.data`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data)) which are able to read our data sources and automatically convert them to tensors and then later on, neural network models will process these for us.\n",
