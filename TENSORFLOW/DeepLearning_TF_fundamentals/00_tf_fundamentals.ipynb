        "\n",
        "[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source end-to-end machine learning library for preprocessing data, modelling data and serving models (getting them into the hands of others).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why use TensorFlow?\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely you'll use a library such as TensorFlow. This is because it contains many of the most common machine learning functions you'll want to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What we're going to cover\n",
        "\n",
        "TensorFlow is vast. But the main premise is simple: turn data into numbers (tensors) and build machine learning algorithms to find patterns in them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we cover some of the most fundamental TensorFlow operations, more specifically:\n",

        "* Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)\n",
