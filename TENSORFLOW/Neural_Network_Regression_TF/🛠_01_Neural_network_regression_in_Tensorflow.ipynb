    "So now it's time to have a **play around** with a few things and start to build up our intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create our own regression dataset (or make the one we created in \"Create data to view and fit\" bigger) and build fit a model to it.\n",
    "2. Try building a neural network with 4 Dense layers and fitting it to our own regression dataset, how does it perform?\n",
    "3. Try and improve the results we got on the insurance dataset, some things we might want to try include:\n",
    "  * Building a larger model (how does one with 4 dense layers go?).\n",
    "  * Increasing the number of units in each layer.\n",
    "  * Lookup the documentation of [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) and find out what the first parameter is, what happens if we increase it by 10x?\n",
    "  * What happens if we train for longer (say 300 epochs instead of 200)? \n",
    "4. Import the [Boston pricing dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/boston_housing/load_data) from TensorFlow [`tf.keras.datasets`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets) and model it.\n"
