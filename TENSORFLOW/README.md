* Inputs(any type/form) > Numerical encoding(matrix/tensor) [[112,223],..]
                        > Learns representation/choose appropriate neural network (patterns/  
                          features/weights)
                        > representational outputs [[0.983,0.004],..]
                        > human understandable outputs

* Types of Learning:
       * supervised
           - data and labels are available
       * semi-supervised
           - some data and some lables
       * unsupervised
           - only data, no labels
           - can't pass data to ML model,neural network or deep learning model
           - not sure about the patterns with this type of data
       * transfer learning
           - learned patters of one deep learning model can be used in another deep learning model
           - food,image discovery / classification model

 * Some deep learning examples: 
       * Recommendation - uses history
       * Translation,Speech recognition - uses sequence to sequence(seq2seq)
       * computer vision - classification/regression
       * Natural language processing (email check, spam/not sapm) - classification/regression

* Tensorflow :
     * GPU - Graphics processing unit
     * TPU - Tensor processing unit
